# DELANI STUDIO

## Description
This is a simple landing page for a fictional studio that provides details about the studio and their range of services.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED

The page is built on most of the basic languages.
These languages used are:

- HTML5 - Used to define the structure of the page.
- CSS - Used to define presentation of the page
- Javascript - Used to define behavior of the page such as hover effects and toggles.

The languages also work hand in hand with some frameworks and libraries such as
- Bootstrap 5 - A CSS framework that eases the process of making responsive sites.
- JQuery - A library that provides us an easier way of writing Javascript.


The workhorses that led to the actualization of this page are:
- Visual Studio Code - The lightweight code editor
- Git and Github - The version control tools for modern day software.
